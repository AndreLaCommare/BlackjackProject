#BlackJack Project

#Description

The purpose of this project was to code a functioning BlackJack card game. The project declares whether or not the dealer or player receives Blackjack in the first hand. Should they both be dealt BlackJack a messaged is displayed offering to play again. Should neither player have BlackJack the game will proceed allowing the player to either hit or stay. After the player busts or chooses to stay, the dealer then proceeds to play. The dealer will hit any hand that has a total value of less than 17. If the dealer busts, or hits above 17 but does not out score the player the player is declared the winner. After each end game scenario the player is asked if they would like to play again.

#Technologies Used

Java, Eclipse

#LessonsLearned

This project again reiterated the nature of abstract methods, that are declared within an abstract class but defined later on within a concrete child of said class. BlackJack also served as an introduction to Java enums. A particular difficulty in BlackJack was learning how to implement methods, that took in other methods return values as parameters in order to achieve game functionality.
